# Use VOIP or Regular Phone Line #

In order to make phone call, Voicent software needs either a regular phone line or VOIP service. It is much easier to setup Voicent with VOIP ([SIP based](http://www.voicent.com/sip), or [Skype](http://www.voicent.com/skype). To use regular phone line, you also need a good quality voice modem. For more details, please select Windows Start Button > All Programs > Voicent > Quick Start Guide.
