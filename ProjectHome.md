This application is based on the VoiceXML technology, a W3C open standard for interactive telephone applications.

VoiceXML applications must be deployed on a VoiceXML gateway. This project uses Voicent's VoiceXML gateway, which is not part of this project. With some minor change, you should be able to deploy this project on other VoiceXML gateway.You can [download a free shareware edition of Voicent Gateway](http://www.voicent.com/download) from Voicentâ€™s website. The shareware edition has no time limit but contains Voicent Ad message for each phone call. For more information about Voicent Gateway and its graphical tool [IVR Studio](http://www.voicent.com/ivr), please visit Voicent's website.
